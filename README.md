## Overview

My first Frontend Mentor challenge, and my first responsive project for mobile and desktop.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use grids and flexbox with an image
- How to change hover state and add animation time
- Responsive design

### Continued development

I'm still not completely comfortable with fitting and scaling images. Flexbox and grids are also things I need to get more used to.
